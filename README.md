# Implementation of k-means clustering

## Python scripts
The repo consists of three scripts:
* `analysis.py`: basic functions that are used repetitively in other scripts;
* `elbow.py`: plots the cost function (elbow method) to find the appropriate number of clusters;
* `iteration.py`: produces table output of clustering based on the number of clusters determined by the elbow plot.

## Notebooks
Notebooks demonstrate how the clustering algorithm defined in the scripts above could be applied
* `example.ipynb` and `new_data_example.ipynb` show worked examples of how k-means clustering is implemented for 2D datasets.
* `t_shirt.ipynb` presents a clustering example of a multi-dimensional dataset.
