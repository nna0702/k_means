# Implementation of k-means clustering

The repo consists of three scripts:
* `analysis.py`: basic functions that are used repetitively in other scripts;
* `elbow.py`: plots the cost function (elbow method) to find the appropriate number of clusters;
* `iteration.py`: produces table output of clustering based on the number of clusters determined by the elbow plot.

The notebook `workings.ipynb` shows a worked example of how k-means clustering is implemented for a 2D dataset.
